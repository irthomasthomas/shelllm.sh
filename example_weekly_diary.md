# Shell Activity Summary – 2025-07-09 → 2025-07-15  
*(7 days of AI-augmented hacking in one page)*

---

## 1. Logging & Environment  
- **AI-powered diary logger**  
  A Zsh hook now captures every “interesting” command, feeds it to an LLM, and writes a one-line diary entry.  
  - Activated on 2025-07-09T21:54:41 – has been running ever since.  
  - Ignores noise (ls, cd, vim, etc.) to keep the feed human-readable.  
- **Environment snapshots**  
  Environment variables are dumped to file whenever requested via a one-liner Python helper:

```bash
python - <<'PY' > .env-snapshot
import os, json, datetime, pathlib
out = pathlib.Path.home()/'.env-snapshot'
out.write_text(json.dumps(dict(os.environ), indent=2))
PY
```

## 2. LLM Tool-chain Refinements  
| **Task** | **Key Commits / Commands** |
|---|---|
| **OpenRouter & Parasail keys** | Added `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `PARASAIL_API_KEY`, `NOVITA_API_KEY`, `MOONSHOT_API_KEY` under `~/keys/`. |
| **New aliases** | `fast-deepseek-r1-t2`, `k2-parasail-t1`, `k2-novita-t1`, `kimi-k2`, `cons-k2-groq` all wired via `llm` plugin. |
| **Caching branches** | Experimented with `feature/prompt-caching`, `feat/claude-caching`, `feature/anthropic-caching` to test prompt-caching headers. All merged or deleted after evaluation. |
| **Reasoning tokens** | Branch `feat/reasoning-option` merged into `main` 2025-07-12T16:05. |

---

## 3. Benchmarking & Reproducible Tests  
Built `shelp_benchmark/` suite (cloned 2025-07-13T18:41).  
Loop:

```bash
for m in k2-parasail-t1 k2-novita-t1 kimi-k2 gemini-flash; do
  shelp --model $m "create file hello.txt with 'Hello from $m'"
done
```

Results auto-appended to `shelp_tests.log`.

## 4. Git Workflow (last 7 days)  
- **Branches created / destroyed**  
  - `feature/prompt-caching` → deleted 2025-07-12T15:16  
  - `feat/claude-caching` → merged  
  - `feat/reasoning-option` → merged  
- **Stash gymnastics**  
  - 3 stashes created, popped, and dropped around 2025-07-12T14:5x.

## 5. Utility Functions Added to `~/.zshrc`  

```zsh
# Visual progress bar
progress_bar() { local i; for i in {1..50}; do printf "\r%s %d/50" "$1" $i; sleep .1; done; echo; }

# Archive & delete directory
compress_and_del_dir() { tar czf "$1.tar.gz" "$1" && rm -rf "$1"; }

# Fuzzy LLM log browser
fzf_db_response() {
  local db=$(llm logs path)
  sqlite3 "$db" "SELECT id, prompt FROM responses ORDER BY id DESC" |
    fzf --reverse --preview 'sqlite3 "'$db'" "SELECT response FROM responses WHERE id = {1}"' |
    cut -f1 | xargs -I{} sqlite3 "$db" "SELECT response FROM responses WHERE id = {}"
}
```

## 7. One-Command Re-cap  
To replay the week in one line:

```bash
llm logs path | xargs sqlite3 -line "select datetime(created,'unixepoch') as day, substr(prompt,1,60) as task from responses where prompt like '%shelp%' order by day desc limit 5"
```
