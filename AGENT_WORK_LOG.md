### Development Log Summary

#### 2025-06-28
*   **Project:** `claude.sh-refactor` (Agent Orchestration)
    *   **Outcome:** Fixed multiple critical issues: resolved global variable declaration errors, fixed array bounds checks, and repaired the summarization agent's database logging. Corrected Zenity GUI menus for single/multi-choice selections.
    *   **New Feature:** Implemented and activated a real-time instruction-compliance monitoring system within the agent's execution loop, with scores updating on each iteration.

*   **Project:** `llm-consortium`
    *   **Outcome:** Fixed a response ID mismatch bug by filtering out failed API responses before assigning IDs. Enhanced error logging and added logic to abort if no models return a successful response.

#### 2025-06-27
*   **Project:** LLM Database Management
    *   **Outcome:** Archived specific `gemini-2.5-flash` model responses from a conversation by appending `:archive` to the `conversation_id`. Corrected an initial error to ensure other model responses in the same conversation remained under the original ID.

*   **Project:** Caching (`llm-anthropic` & `llm-openrouter`)
    *   **Outcome (Analysis):** Finalized caching strategy: `llm-anthropic` will use a simple `--cache` flag, while `llm-openrouter` retains granular `cache_user` and `cache_system` options.
    *   **Outcome (Implementation):** Confirmed ephemeral `cache_control` is working correctly in both plugins. Identified that fragment and attachment caching are the primary remaining tasks.

*   **Project:** `llm-openrouter` (Caching Fix)
    *   **Outcome:** Fixed Claude caching in conversations. Cache control is now only applied to the current prompt, not historical messages, resolving an API limitation.

#### 2025-06-26
*   **Project:** `llm-openrouter` (Caching Feature)
    *   **Outcome:** Implemented Anthropic prompt caching with `--cache-system` and `--cache-user` CLI options. Fixed a `NameError` by reordering a class definition and resolved an API error by correctly removing custom arguments before the API call.

*   **Project:** System/Output Handling
    *   **Outcome:** A test with `seq 1 500` confirmed that long outputs are displayed completely without being truncated or automatically saved to a file.

*   **Project:** Agent Framework Analysis
    *   **Outcome:** Summarized `agent_bash_concise.sh`, identifying its core functions for agent initialization, LLM interaction, command execution, and logging.

#### 2025-06-25
*   **Project:** `llm` (CLI Tool)
    *   **Outcome:** Fixed a v0.26 regression where model alias options were not saved. The `aliases_set` command was missing logic for handling options when a `model_id` was provided directly. Added comprehensive tests.
