Today (15 July) you were deep in LLM agent development & benchmarking:
1. **Environment & Debugging**  
   – Enabled `DEBUG=true` to trace agent runs, toggled it off again later for cleaner output.

2. **Agent Refactor & Upgrade**  
   – Used `f2p` + `prompt_engineer` to iteratively rewrite the agent harness:  
   • Removed hard-coded stop-sequences and replaced them with YAML-configurable variables (`deepbloom.yaml`, `agent_tags.yaml`).  
   • Added per-interaction UUIDs for reproducibility.  
   • Upgraded prompts for “Deepbloom Scavenger Mode” and “Shell Interaction Mode.”  
   – Patched the refactored code in-place with `shelp-x k2-groq` and applied the generated patches.

3. **Testing Pipeline**  
   – Made `/home/thomas/Projects/K2/scripts/run-tests-v2.sh` executable and kicked off the new test suite.  
   – Ran several targeted tests (via `shelp`) with models `k2-groq`, `k2-novita-t1`, `kimi-k2`, etc.  
   – Logged results to `shelp_tests.log` and generated `shelp_test_report.md`.

4. **Project House-Keeping**  
   – Explored directory structures under `llm_consortium` and `REFACTOR/PASS` to locate scripts and Python examples.  
   – Compressed old experiment directories (`compress_and_del_dir`) to keep the workspace tidy.

Overall, today was a concentrated push to harden the agent framework—turning fragile shell scripts into a configurable, testable, reproducible system.
