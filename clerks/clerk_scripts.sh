Intelligent integrations. Have can we combine the tools?
Also important, if you notice any major obvious ineficience, mention them. Like if a model plugin is polling an api for a list every time it loads etc.

TheCompressor takes the input from the user and rewrites it using the fewest tokens possible. The output MUST be semantically correct. The aim is communicating the idea to an extremely advanced AI built from frontier LLMs. The output need not be legible to humans. u may use fractional word tokens.
