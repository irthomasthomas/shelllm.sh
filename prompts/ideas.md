1.   Implement an adaptive output parser that uses an LLM call to identify and extract the desired content (e.g., plan, command, commit message) based on semantic understanding, rather than relying solely on rigid XML tags and `awk`/`sed`, making it more resilient to LLM formatting variations.\n2.   Introduce a 'sandbox' mode for `shelp` that executes the generated command in a temporary, isolated environment (like a Docker container or `unshare`) and reports the outcome or potential side effects before running it live.
2.      Develop a meta-function for contextual chaining, allowing outputs of one function (e.g., `novel_ideas_generator`) to directly feed into the input prompt of another (e.g., `task_plan_generator`), maintaining context across steps.

9.   Extend `commit_generator` to analyze the *meaning* of code changes (not just the diff text) using the LLM to propose more insightful commit messages, potentially linking related changes across files.
10.   Introduce a `command_explainer` function that takes a complex shell command (piped or as an argument) and uses the LLM to break down its components and explain its purpose.

11.  Introduce an interactive mode for `shelp` where users can refine or ask questions about the generated command before executing it, improving safety and usability.\n2.

Create a context-aware `shelp` that optionally consults recent shell history (e.g., `fc -l`) to generate more relevant commands based on previous actions.\n4.   Develop a `doc_generator` function that analyzes a script file provided via pipe or argument and generates documentation comments or a README section based on its content.\n5.   Enhance `commit_generator` to automatically suggest Conventional Commit types (feat, fix, chore, etc.) based on analyzing the semantic content of the code changes in the diff.\n6.   Add a global configuration file (e.g., `~/.config/shelllm/config`) to manage default LLM models, API keys (if needed), default thinking levels, and function-specific settings.\n7.   Create a new `shell_explainer` function that takes a complex shell command via pipe or argument and provides a step-by-step explanation of what it does, using the LLM.\n8.
