# Project Name

## Project Description
This repository contains a collection of shell scripts and Python utilities that enhance the user experience and provide various functionalities. The main features include:

1. **Prompt Improvement**: The `prompt-improver` function allows users to improve their command prompt with additional information and verbosity based on their request.
2. **Shell Command Explanation**: The `shell-explain` function provides detailed explanations of shell commands, with the level of verbosity determined by the user's request.
3. **Shell Command Generation**: The `shell-commander` function generates shell commands based on user prompts, and the `shell-scripter` function creates complete shell scripts.
4. **Mindstorm Generation**: The `mindstorm-generator` function generates a mindstorm of ideas based on a user prompt, with the option to specify a particular language model.
5. **Python Code Explanation**: The `py-explain` function provides explanations of Python code, with the level of verbosity determined by the user's request.

## Installation
To use the functionality provided by this repository, you will need to have the following dependencies installed:

- `llm` (Large Language Model) utility
- `pv` (Pipe Viewer) utility

You can install these dependencies using your system's package manager. For example, on a Unix-based system, you can run the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install llm pv
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can clone the repository and source the relevant shell scripts in your terminal environment.

## Usage

### Prompt Improvement
To use the `prompt-improver` function, run the following command:

```
prompt-improver [verbosity] "user prompt"
```

Replace `[verbosity]` with the desired level of verbosity (e.g., `1`, `3`, `9`). The function will improve the user's prompt and display the result.

### Shell Command Explanation
To use the `shell-explain` function, run the following command:

```
shell-explain [verbosity] "shell command"
```

Replace `[verbosity]` with the desired level of verbosity. The function will provide a detailed explanation of the shell command.

### Shell Command Generation
To use the `shell-commander` function, run the following command:

```
shell-commander "user prompt"
```

The function will generate a shell command based on the user's prompt and display the result.

To use the `shell-scripter` function, run the following command:

```
shell-scripter "user prompt"
```

The function will generate a complete shell script based on the user's prompt, display the reasoning and explanation, and print the script.

### Mindstorm Generation
To use the `mindstorm-generator` function, run the following command:

```
mindstorm-generator [-m|--model model_name] "user prompt"
```

Replace `model_name` with the desired language model (e.g., `claude-3.5-sonnet`). If no model is specified, the function will use the `claude-3.5-sonnet` model by default. The function will generate a mindstorm of ideas based on the user's prompt and display the result.

### Python Code Explanation
To use the `py-explain` function, run the following command:

```
py-explain [verbosity] "python code"
```

Replace `[verbosity]` with the desired level of verbosity. The function will provide a detailed explanation of the Python code.
