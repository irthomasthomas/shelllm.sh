# Shell Script Repository

## Project Description

This repository contains a collection of shell scripts that provide various utilities and functionalities. The scripts are designed to enhance productivity, automate repetitive tasks, and provide intelligent solutions to common challenges. These scripts leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate responses, provide explanations, and assist users in various ways.

## Installation

To use the scripts in this repository, you will need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Bash
- `llm` command-line tool (or an equivalent LLM-based tool)

You can clone the repository and add the scripts to your system's `PATH` variable or create symbolic links to them.

## Usage

The repository contains the following shell scripts:

### Shell-related Scripts

1. **`shell-commander`**: This script allows you to execute shell commands with the help of an LLM. It provides a response with the reasoning behind the recommended command and the actual command to be executed.
2. **`shell-explain`**: This script explains the purpose and functionality of a given shell command or script.
3. **`shell-scripter`**: This script generates shell scripts based on user input, providing both the script and an explanation of its functionality.

### Prompt Improvement and Generation

1. **`prompt-improver`**: This script enhances user prompts by adding relevant information and improving the overall quality based on the user's requested verbosity level.
2. **`mindstorm-ideas-generator`**: This script generates creative ideas and brainstorming suggestions based on user input and the requested verbosity level.

### Code Explanation and Visualization

1. **`py-explain`**: This script explains the functionality of a given Python code snippet with the desired level of verbosity.
2. **`digraph_generator`**: This script generates a digraph (directed graph) visualization based on user input and the requested verbosity level.

### Search and Planning

1. **`search_term_engineer`**: This script generates high-quality search queries for search engines based on user input and the requested verbosity level.
2. **`write_agent_plan`**: This script writes an agent plan (a step-by-step plan of action) based on a task description and the requested verbosity level.
3. **`write_task_plan`**: This script writes a detailed task plan (a step-by-step plan for completing a task) based on a task description and the requested verbosity level.

### Analytical Hierarchy Process

1. **`analytical_hierarchy_process_generator`**: This script generates an Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) analysis based on user-provided ideas, criteria, and weights.

### Commit Message Generator

1. **`commit`**: This script generates a commit message for a Git repository based on the changes made, using an LLM to provide a high-quality, concise, and informative commit message.

Each script has its own usage instructions and example usages, which can be found in the script files themselves.
