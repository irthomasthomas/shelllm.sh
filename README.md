## Shell Scripts

### `shelllm.sh`

The `shelllm.sh` script is designed to improve a user's prompt based on their request. It utilizes a large language model (LLM) to generate a more verbose and informative prompt, with the level of verbosity controlled by the user's input.

Usage:
```
shell-explain [<verbosity>] <command>
```

### `shell-commander.sh`

The `shell-commander.sh` script allows users to input a command, and the script will use an LLM to provide the reasoning behind the command and generate the command itself. This can be useful for users who are unfamiliar with certain shell commands.

Usage:
```
shell-commander <command>
```

Alias: `shelp`

### `shell-scripter.sh`

The `shell-scripter.sh` script generates a shell script based on a user's prompt. It uses an LLM to provide reasoning for the script, an explanation of its functionality, and the script itself.

Usage:
```
shell-scripter <prompt>
```

### `mindstorm-generator.sh`

The `mindstorm-generator.sh` script generates a "mindstorm" of ideas based on a user's prompt. It utilizes an LLM to produce a list of creative and innovative ideas related to the user's input.

Usage:
```
mindstorm-generator [-m|--model <model>] <prompt>
```

## Python Scripts

### `py-explain.sh`

The `py-explain.sh` script provides explanations for Python code, with the level of detail controlled by the user's input. It uses an LLM to generate a concise explanation of the code's purpose and functionality.
